a.

In a process of Linux based operating system, standard output is the file descriptor which gets the id 1.
So if we need to redirect the I/O from stdout to out, we can use dup2(out, 1)
(STDOUT_FILENO is another preprocessor we can use instead on 1 in here)

b.i.

Yes.
dup(int) function interchange the given file descriptor with the lowest numbered unused fie descriptor.
This is useful when we need to create a new file descriptor from an existing one.
dup2(int, int) function interchange two given file descriptors. This is useful when we need to change a file descriptor with known other file descriptor.
